## Project Dependencies
### Languages Used:
The development of myFlix-client involves using three primary languages:

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** HTML is the backbone of web development. It provides the structure for web pages and applications, ensuring content is organized and accessible.

2. **JSX (JavaScript XML):** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, often used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows developers to write HTML elements and components in a JavaScript file.

3. **SCSS (Sassy CSS):** SCSS is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It allows for more maintainable and organized stylesheets.

 Package Dependencies:
The following packages play a crucial role in shaping the myFlix-client project:
1. **React:** React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of complex UIs through a component-based architecture.

2. **ReactDOM:** ReactDOM is a library used to render React components in the DOM (Document Object Model). It bridges the gap between React components and the actual DOM manipulation.
### Technologies Used:
- **Parcel:** Parcel is a web application bundler that greatly simplifies the process of setting up a web project. It handles various tasks such as transpiling, bundling, and code splitting.
